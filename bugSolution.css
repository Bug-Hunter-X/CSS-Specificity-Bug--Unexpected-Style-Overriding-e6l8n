The solution involves understanding and correctly managing CSS specificity.  In this case, you could resolve the issue by either adjusting the specificity of the selectors or reorganizing the order of CSS declarations. One approach is to be more explicit in your selectors using the `!important` flag (generally not recommended, but useful for demonstration purposes) or by restructuring the CSS to avoid conflicts.

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}

div p {
  color: red !important; /* Not recommended, but shows one way to override */
}
```

Another, cleaner solution involves rewriting the CSS to avoid specificity issues:

```css
.my-paragraph {
    color: blue;
}
div .my-paragraph {
    color: red;
}
```
By using classes, you can explicitly target specific elements without relying on potentially conflicting implicit selectors and avoiding unnecessary `!important` overrides.
